-- Acceptance test for Tracker: at0.txt 
-- ASCII comments may occur at the beginning or in the middle of a line.
-- Very Basic Use Case to:
--	set tracker radiation parameters
--	create some phases
--	add some containers
--	move some containers

-- Phases are sorted by pid
-- Containers are sorted by cid
-- Sorting follows normal lexicographic string rules,
-- so that pid11 is before pid4; use pid04 if you want pid4 earlier. 

-- create a new tracker
-- max. radiation in a phase is 50.0
-- max. radiation in a container is 10.0
new_tracker(50.0, 10.0)
remove_phase("pid1")
remove_phase("pid4")

-- add 2 phases each having a container handling capacity of 2:
new_phase("pid2", "compacting", 2, <<glass, metal, plastic>>)
remove_phase("pid1")
remove_phase("pid4")
